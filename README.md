### EDA:

__Method:__
```python
readData(base_dir_path)
```
__Output:__
```console
Total Number of Classes in train DataSet:  95
Total Number of Classes in test DataSet:  95
Total Number of train samples:  48905
Total Number of test samples: 16421
```
__Method:__
```python
understandData(base_dir_path,'train')
```
__Output:__
```console
CLASS NAME          NUMBER OF IMAGES
Apple Braeburn      492
Apple Golden 1      492
Apple Golden 2      492
Apple Golden 3      481
Apple Granny Smith  492
```

## Approch:
+ I used MobileNetV2 architecutre, pre-trained on ImageNet dataset for feature extraction.

+ Next I use these features and ran through a new classifier, which is trained from scratch.

+ As stated in my Favourite Book: __Deep Learning with Python__. 
We took convolitional base(conv_base) of Mobilenet, ran new data through it and trained a new classifier on top of
the output.

So basically, I extended the conv_base by adding Dense layer followed by DropOut layer, and running 
whole network on input data with data augmentation. well this is bit expensive, but meh!! I have enough processing power.

+ Important Thing, I freeze the convolutional base so as to avoid updating their weights.

### TODO:
+ Test with more epochs.
+ add method to Evaluate prediction accuracy and loss on whole test dataset
+ Add docStrings for each of the function you have written.
