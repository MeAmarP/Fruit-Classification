## Approch
+ I used MobileNetV2 architecutre, pre-trained on ImageNet dataset for feature extraction.

+ Next I use these features and ran through a new classifier, which is trained from scratch.

+ As stated in my Favourite Book: __Deep Learning with Python__. 
We took convolitional base(conv_base) of Mobilenet, ran new data through it and trained a new classifier on top of
the output.

So basically, I extended the conv_base by adding Dense layer followed by DropOut layer, and running 
whole network on input data with data augmentation. well this is bit expensive, but meh!! I have enough processing power.

+ Important Thing, I freeze the convolutional base so as to avoid updating their weights.


TODO:
+ Add Image of EDA and assocoated written functions.
+ Add docStrings for each of the function you have written
